‘Ubuntu’ - I am because I belong
'Ubuntu', a term from southern Africa, is actually much more than a word, it's a world! It takes us back to the roots of humanism, emphasizing the relational and community dimension of the person; including openness to others, kindness, generosity and unconditional love. In this film, we tread in the footsteps of Nelson Mandela, who sought to put into practice 'Ubuntu' in his own life to achieve reconciliation between blacks and whites in South Africa after apartheid. 
 
The two main contributors to this film are Father Laurent Fabre, founder and leader of the Chemin Neuf Community and Bishop Emmanuel Lafont, Catholic Bishop of French Guyana, who lived in South Africa for a long time and knew Nelson Mandela personally.
